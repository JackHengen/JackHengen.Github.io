Fix:
Load images quicker

For sure:
Stylize every page
Have each movie be a fancy log
Make fancy ratings for each movie
Images class with a desc and a category and a time etc.-sort by, get random feature with more info
	-image description, images are rendered with an onclick which opens dialogue with description
Photos - custom border by stacking the border photo on top of the photo OR border-image

For future:
Slideshow on homemenu or somewhere
Alert when crossword is ready and worldle is ready-maybe be able to embed somehow
Upload images straight torwards the website and have it pop up
Be able to add movies to list of to watch
SONG LIST, Playlist for each other to list or something.
