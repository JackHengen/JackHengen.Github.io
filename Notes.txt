Fix:
Load images quicker
Have spotify audio stay the same throughout pages

For sure:
Nav is gonna be a dropdown menu - animated to slide out - 
Add navs to everything
Stylize every page
Have each movie be a fancy log
Make fancy ratings for each movie

For future:
Alert when crossword is ready and worldle is ready-maybe be able to embed somehow
Upload images straight torwards the website and have it pop up
Images class with a desc and a category and a time etc.-sort by, get random feature with more info
Be able to add movies to list of to watch
SONG LIST, Playlist for each other to list or something.
