            Dear syd,
            <br><br>
            I fucking love you so much. You're the best person in the world wide world. I have never really stayed in communication with people once school ends but you are obviously different. You are absolutely amazing and being away from you in college makes it easy to see just how fucking lucky I am to have you. I seriously don’t know what I could do without you. 
            <br><br>
            You have changed my life in so many ways. In addition to countless other things, I read so much more because of you and I look forward to reading. I fold my clothes, and I try to make my bed and clean my room. I journal (and it is totally helping me keep organized and remember assignments and set goals for my day). Most importantly however, you have helped me understand my emotions and who I am. You have consistently helped me when I was sad, and comforted me. I find myself overthinking less and less, and knowing what to do to snap myself out of it. You haven’t only helped me with my negative emotions however, I don’t know how to explain it but I feel like I know more about myself and have become more emotionally mature.
            <br><br>
            You inspire me to get into the gym and eat healthy. Everytime I feel like slacking I know that you are working hard in the gym and killing it and you are rooting for me to do the same. I also want to look good for you. I know you say I look perfect but I want to look the best I can for you. You inspire me to do well in school, you always help tutor me, influence me to prioritize my school work, and set a good example for me with your own habits and work ethic. Your influence is always at least slightly behind everything I do in my life.
            <br><br>
            Enough about us though, why are you the most amazing person in the world?
            <br><br>
            You are such a genius, you have crazy grades and SAT scores, but I also see that you are amazing at reading, writing and math. You read dozens of books a year, more than I ever could dream of. I can totally see you working as a scientist at nasa. Space is a passion of yours and so is math. Please please please go into this field, I could totally see you making it big as a giant nerd. Your level of genius is sexy and it is inspiring.
            <br><br>
            Your genius goes hand in hand with your hard work. You are very dedicated to school and to skating. You always complete your work on time, you study very hard, and you always wake up at the crack of dawn to skate. I totally believe you are one of the hardest workers I know.
            <br><br>
            You are a crazy skater. I think it's amazing and I think you're amazing at it. I also appreciate you having a hobby you are so invested in. I love hearing you talk about skating and I hope to see your next skating competitions.
            <br><br>
            You are hilarious, I know I wasn’t sure if you were funny at first and you always get mad at me for that but YOU ARE HILARIOUS, I mean it!!! I love your impressions of helga, or mocking me and all the other goofy silly stuff you do. I love how we can always laugh by stealing each other's nose or getting into each other's face and asking each other if they will judge us for eating mac.
            <br><br>
            Last but not least you’re a fucking sexy beast and a dick witch.
            <br><br>
            There is so much more that makes you such an amazing person, too much to list. So much more than this letter or the last letter’s list of “reasons I love you”.I am so grateful for everything you are and everything you’ve done for me.
            <br><br>
            I really look forward to being with you forever, to after college when we are living together and designing our space, to being interconnected with your family and have to have tons of holidays together, to raising a bunch of pets with you, to creating a math website that defeats khan academy and to us inevitably getting married and having a bunch of children named batman, and growing old together and dying at the same time, holding hands in the same bed (like the notebook).
            <br><br>
            I’ve been working on this gift for a while. Before you I hadn’t been the best at gift giving, I had never written a love letter (Lol this definitely qualifies as one of those) or spent more than 30 minutes of thought on someone's gift. However, I put the most thought into this gift than any other gift I had ever given anyone else (by a long shot). Now I have a person who I care about enough and am excited to spoil as much as possible. You are worth it.
            <br><br>
            At this point you have almost definitely guessed what your gift is. I suck at keeping secrets.

            I had to edit a lot of this card down to make it fit so there is the extended note on the website.
            <br><br>
            Happy birthday and happy 5 month anniversary to the best thing that has ever happened to be.

            Ps: Nerdy stuff. I had to learn a lot to create this site. I had to learn a whole framework (node js), how to host my site on the web, and I had to sharpen my base javascript skills.
